5/5

Did you do a thorough job exploring your data [10 points]

Mostly, but I had some questions:

- Width appears to be right skewed, not left skewed
- I'm not sure I understand your sharpness scores - your text does not match the histogram, which would suggest most images are quite blurry?
- When generating a word cloud, it is important to remove words that are not meaningful.  Obviously here, \[start\] and \[end\], but stopwords should also get dropped.

10/10

Have you done some initial modeling of your problem and do you have some early baseline results? [10 points]

I would have like to have seen some preliminary analysis at this point, but I recognize this is a challenging dataset.
